                    It's not the most important meal but making oatmeal or toast or fancy yogurt really makes the day feel more handle-able! I usually make a fancy hot cereal with honey, yogurt with granola and fruit, or a fancy nut butter toast situation. Sometimes when we have time it's an omelette or pancakes or hash browns situation.

                    I get the ick from eggs a LOT. So I go through breakfast phases. When I like eggs itâ€™s usually scrambled or over easy eggs with white rice (or toast) and turkey sausage, when I have the ick from eggs itâ€™s usually a smoothie, overnight oats, or my homemade granola bars. Been really trying to limit my processed foods except for the turkey sausage bc that shit is tasty. Thatâ€™s all!

                    Since having my baby, my go-to breakfast is coffee and an egg sandwich - I cook the egg on the Dash waffle maker and put it on a mini everything bagel with mayo and hot sauce. Before that, I commuted to work and ate a yogurt cup at my desk. Sometimes I'll have savory oatmeal with an egg, cheese, green onions, olive oil, and salt.

                    I cook breakfast to entice my kids to get up in the morning. It usually consists of fruit, protein, and some carbs. For example, this morning's breakfast was buttery fried corn with sausage, fried egg, raspberries and grapes. Cooking breakfast is my wakeup routine.

                    I've definitely been through periods in my life where I cooked myself a full breakfast every morning, usually when under/unemployed or working primarily evenings. Tamago kake gohan has been a favorite of mine for a "cooked" breakfast which is fast, hot, and delicious

                    Oh man, so many variables! Clarifying statements and questions on the above:
1. I (Liv) will cook a breakfast just for Aly as often, (if not more so), as cooking for the both of us. I like cooking breakfast, but don't always feel like eating until 10 or 11a.
2. Aly will also often bake things on the weekend to serve as breakfast supplements during the week days; Apple cake, muffins, home-made granola, etc. Not sure if this counts
3.Do smoothies count as cooking? They definitely take a respectable amount of work and make some dishes.
4. How about breakfasts with one quick component and one cooked element? For example, half a grapefruit as-is, plus a vegetarian sausage patty that is cooked?

                    Spouse and I almost always eat breakfast at home. It starts with Coffee Hour - coffee, pet and human cuddles, and convo.  Food comes after. During the week I alternate between over-easy/scrambled eggs and toast; toast PB and banana; yogurt with fruit, nuts, and honey; and cereal (hot or cold depending on the season) On the weekend, I might make omelets or waffles, or my spouse might make pancakes.  Breakfast for Dinner happens from time to time, too.

                    I have one very large cup of coffee w creamer. One hour later I have two or three scrambled eggs with sweet peppers and a little shredded cheese in them. If Iâ€™m feeling frisky I will fry a couple pieces of bacon or more likely some deli ham.  I do this five days a week. Weekends often do it as well but also flexible for going out or doing something different.

                    Every morning: one egg, fried; two pieces of toast, and pot of tea. If it's an athletic day (big bike ride, hike) then it's two eggs. Pancakes sometimes. Homemade granola subbing for toast if I'm out of bread. Never skip breakfast, EVER - a path to misery for me. I'd rather skip lunch than breakfast.

                    I have a protein shake when I first wake up and then cook a breakfast sandwich about an hour after I finish my shake. I cannot start my day if I have not had both my shake and sandwich.

                    always have breakfast (especially if Iâ€™m having coffee) because otherwise Iâ€™m sluggish and it screws up your gut to drink coffee on an empty stomach! I have eggs most days, with fruit/bread/etc. if Iâ€™m in a rush I have Greek yogurt

                    My breakfast used to be a cigarette and a coffee but I gave up tobacco 4.5 years ago (thanks, Covid!). Now I find I'm sluggish and unfocused until I eat lunch if I skip my usual two fried eggs topped with feta and piece of fruit and only have the coffee. I couldn't tell you what it's like without even the coffee, not sure I'd make it out the house.

                    I need to eat breakfast but it doesn't tend to be elaborate at all- yogurt and granola, oatmeal, smoothie, sometimes I'll meal prep a batch of muffins. Eggs probably 1ish weekday a week? I try and save buying breakfast as an occasional treat, usually Gimme pastries, Ithaca bakery breakfast sandwich, or Dunkin breakfast sandwich.

                    Strong hot black tea with: oatmeal or cold cereal with yoghurt; or toast with pb and banana; weekends, eggs or omelet with toast. This has been routine for many years; I'm not very functional if I skip breakfast

                    I have a complicated relationship with breakfast. I do think bfast can be the most important meal of the day, but I am often not at all hungry enough for it until around 10 or 11am. A delicious egg breakfast with veggies and toast, along with a cup of tea or coffee, is a dream! BUT: it totally zaps my energyâ€¦ I often do best with a smoothie or a quick breakfast bar. And coffee on an empty stomach makes me irritable!
I just came back from visiting my mother. Sheâ€™s all about the multi-course bfast. Start with fresh cut fruit. Then an egg main dish. Then bfast dessert! (a muffin, croissant, toast w/ jam etc)

                    A pretty good mix of 1 and 2, probably more 2 if youâ€™re counting a piece of toast any time before lunch. Itâ€™s like 3 hours after I get up, hard to call  it breakfast anymore but itâ€™s eating something before lunch ðŸ¤“

                    Not super important. My mom prepares it, and I probably wouldnâ€™t eat much breakfast were it not for that. A typical breakfast for me includes some kind of fruit, some pancakes, and a hard-boiled egg.

                    I ALWAYS eat breakfast. Never leave my house without eating. My staples are: 
- Ham & Cheese sandwich (fried egg optional)
- 2 eggs with toast or hashbrowns 
- oatmeal with fruit, nuts and cheese (or egg)

Also, I have a coffee every morning.

Having 3 meals a day is a non-negotiable for me.

On the weekends I have an egg sandwich or rice and kimchi with a fried egg.

                    While I was in school I prepared/cooked something, or at least had something minimal prep every day for breakfast. Now that I've started my new job I haven't had time to do that, so I buy but I can see it adding up and want to find a meal-prep plan to help make it less expensive.

                    I love breakfast, and when I was working full time, I did eat it, but since quitting my job and starting vet school, everything has been chaotic and I haven't been eating breakfast much. Sometimes a snack. I need to get into the breakfast meal prep so I'm not so hungry during classes/labs

                    I have an early lunch around 10/11am because I go to work at 6am. I guess that could be considered breakfast for someone who goes to work a regular 9-5 though lol I usually eat lunch foods though. Salads, wraps, etc
