    finding meaning in the mundane
</p>

Every week I send out a tiny anonymous survey to my friends, to my local community, and to the internet about something I'm really curious about. Any time I find myself wondering, "is this just something weird that _I_ do, or is everyone like this?" I put it in the list.

<!-- 

What is 7 Second Surveys really about?

- it's about finding things that everyone is wondering but no one is talking about
    - the most interesting part is in what themes come up in the free form writing
    - sometimes I have something I feel strongly about, and I think I am the only one. And sometimes i AM the only one
    - if it's just me, ok w/e. but if ALL of us are having this problem and we think we're alone?? then we should talk about it
- "empirical film"
- it's an accessible, fun exercise in finding truth
